# taquin_game

## About
this is a school project implemented in python to showcase the different search methods to find the solution to a taquin game:
- blind search methods
    - DFS
    - BFS
    - DFL
- heuristic methods(to be implemented)

## Tests
I used the Unittest framework for unit testing.  
testing files:
- src/node_test.py

## How to use 
you can use the CLI by running the src/CLI_showcase.py file and you can change the parameters of the solution method to change the algorithm.  
or you can use the GUI by running the src/main.py.
